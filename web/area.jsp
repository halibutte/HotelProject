            <p>The big skies and sparkling landscape of marshland fields, feathery reeds and tangled woodlands are a perfect canvas for adventure and relaxation - time to reflect, space to explore, a magical opportunity to enjoy a fabulous break.</p>
            <p>This is the Venice of the East – in fact, the Norfolk Broads has more miles of waterway than the Italian city! It also has more waterways than Amsterdam!</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.visitnorfolk.co.uk/explore/Broads.aspx">Broads National Park</a> offers visitors an experience unlike any other, both on its rivers and lakes, and alongside them, on peaceful paths and cycle ways.</p>
            <p>Without a doubt, the best way to discover the Broads is by boat. So much of the Broads can't be reached by road that days - and nights - afloat become a real adventure, with hidden places, perfect fishing spots and close encounters with wildlife at every turn.</p>
            <p>The famous Broads motor cruisers have been holiday favourites since the 1930s, and today’s boats have all the comforts of home on board, so even if you prefer to visit during the quieter, cooler months, you'll have a cosy base for your explorations.</p>
            <p>With fresh air, sparkling water and wide horizons by day, and wonderfully dark, starry nights, a boating holiday on the Broads is an unforgettable experience.</p>
            <p>There are plenty of places along the meandering waterways for you to moor up and hop out to explore pretty villages and market towns, or to stop at a welcoming pub.</p>

            <p>Norwich boasts two cathedrals - <a href="https://www.cathedral.org.uk/">Norwich Cathedral (Anglican)</a> and the imposing Roman Catholic Cathedral of St John the Baptist (left).</p>
            <p>The latter stands at one of the highest points in the city. It was begun in 1884 and opened in 1910. The architects were George Gilbert Scott junior and his brother, John Oldrid Scott. The style is a very pure form of 13th-century Decorated Early English, a fine example of revival architecture.</p>
            <p>St John's is the second largest Catholic cathedral in the United Kingdom.</p>
            <p>In the heart of Norwich stands the Cathedral, separated from the busy streets by flint walls and entrance gates, but still a living part of the city. At least three services are held in the Cathedral every day, often sung by the choir. The choristers are pupils of King Edward VI School, which has its daily assembly in the Cathedral. Concerts, lectures and exhibitions also frequently take place here.</p>
            <p>The Cathedral was begun in 1096, the vision of Herbert de Losinga, first bishop of Norwich. Building work on the Cathedral, a bishop's palace and the associated Benedictine monastery continued throughout his life, but the Cathedral was not finally consecrated until 1278. The building is mainly of Caen stone, a pale, honey-coloured limestone brought over from Normandy, but Norfolk flints form the core of the Cathedral, and stone from Northamptonshire was used for medieval additions.</p>
            <p>This great church has a Norman ground plan and walls, and a Perpendicular roof and spire, added after a fire caused by lightning destroyed the wooden roof and spire in 1463. The Cathedral spire is 315 ft (96m) high - second only in height to that of Salisbury. Below the tower, late medieval flying buttresses support the roof at the east end. The decision to replace the wooden roof of the nave with stone vaulting was taken by Bishop Walter Lyhart. Running from east to west, the stone ribs are joined by painted bosses that tell the story of the Bible from the Creation to the Last judgement.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://scva.ac.uk/">Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts</a> building was opened in 1978. It was designed between 1974 and 1976 by the then relatively unknown architect Norman Foster (now Lord Foster). According to Chris Abel, the building exemplifies Foster's early work of "a regular structure embracing all functions within a single, flexible enclosure, or 'universal space'" where "the design is all about allowing for change, internally and externally." The Sainsbury Centre also demonstrates Foster's characteristic work methods of "design development", or "integrated design". It is situated on the western edge of the university's campus, beside the River Yare, and also houses the School of World Art Studies and Museology. Foster said of the building "A building is only as good as its client and the architecture of the Sainsbury Centre is inseparable from the enlightenment and the driving force of the Sainsburys themselves and the support of the University of East Anglia."</p>
            <p>The main building is sited on sloping, turfed ground, and consists of a large cuboid, clad steel structure. One face is almost entirely glazed, with the prefabricated skeleton clearly visible. Internally, the museum gives the impression of being one vast open space, lacking any internal divisions to interfere with the interplay of natural and artificial light. Services, lighting, toilets and maintenance access are housed in triangular towers and trusses, and between the external cladding and internal aluminium louvres.</p>
            <p>By the late 1980s the collection had outgrown its accommodation, and Foster was asked to design an extension. Rather than simply extending the existing structure as had been envisaged 15 years earlier, it was decided to look below ground. The sloping site allowed for an enlarged basement to emerge at a curved glass frontage overlooking a man-made lake (an echo of the nearby 13th century Norfolk Broads). There is little clue of the extent of the new wing, except when viewed from the position of this lake. The crescent wing was built by Anthony Hunt Associates and opened in 1991.</p>
